# php_basics_treehouse

This course was undertaken in preparation of continuing my learning of Wordpress site and theme development and provided a more detailed overview of php than I was anticipating. There were some similarities with Javascript but also some fundamental differences. I enjoyed using php to display data held in separate data files. I found the form submission portion of the course to be quite challenging and think I will need to review this portion again before I am confident implementing this functionality in my own projects.

In the php basics Treehouse course, I have learnt about:

- variables (integers, floats, strings)
- commenting in php code
- operators (arithmatic, assignment, increment / decrement, comparison)
- escape sequences
- concatination of strings
- conditionals using if, elseif, else statements
- date() function in different formats
- basic use in html to call in strings and include other php files using include
- switch statements
- arrays, including indexed arrays, adding array elements, removing array elements, editing array elements, modifying arrays, associative arrays, multidimensional arrays, sorting arrays
- Loops - do while and while loops, for and foreach loops
- Functions - arguments, default arguments, returning values, variable functions, closures, string functions, array functions

Error handling

- turning errors on / off using php.ini, .htaccess and individual php files
- general error handling
- logging errors

Building a php website

- Using php code on a site
- Using include to incorporate content from separate php documents
- Separate header / footer php documents
- Using variables to change page titles
- Using $_GET\["category"\] to change content depending upon category in url
- Looping through an array to generate page content
- using array_rand and foreach loop to add four random items to the main page
- creating breadcrumb links
- creating a details page that generates the content from the database based upon which item is selected, including using implode() to generate a link from a nested array where necessary

Adding a form to a php website

- formatting a form to output to a php file
- a shortcut for concatination by adding output to a variable using .=
- form validation
