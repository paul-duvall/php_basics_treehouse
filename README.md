# php_basics_treehouse

In the php basics Treehouse course, I have learnt about:

- variables (integers, floats, strings)
- commenting in php code
- operators (arithmatic, assignment, increment / decrement, comparison)
- escape sequences
- concatination of strings
- conditionals using if, elseif, else statements
